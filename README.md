# simon-says-swift-game

Simon says is a simple memory game made entirely with Swift without using any framework.

I've completed this project as an exercise to gain a deeper look into the Swift programming language, I used storyboard for the UI and adapted the UI between iPhone and iPad so the experience is uniform between the two platforms.

Thank you.
